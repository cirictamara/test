					<h2>Whitepaper</h2>
						<p class = "font-weight-bold ls-1 fs-17">Hi! We are the eCyber team and we're pleased to meet you.</p>
						<p class = "mb-4">In this whitepaper we will cover the details of eCyber NFT collection and our future plans.</p>
						<h3>What is eCyber Project?</h3>
						<p class = "mb-4">eCyber consists of 3 interconnected NFT collections. It is an interactive comic book NFT project that has never been built on the blockchain network.</p>
						<h3>What is Interactive Comic Book?</h3>
						<p>It is a system where NFT holders participate in decisions that can directly affect the course of the story through weekly voting.</p>
						<p>For example, at a critical point in the story, we will offer members of our community the option to decide the direction of the story. The next part of the comic will be shaped in line with the decision of the majority. In this way, the bond formed between our community and the brand we have created will increase in an unprecedented way with each published episode. After the story is finished online, the actual printing period will begin.</p>
						<p class = "mb-4">All of the income from the printed editions of our comic book, which ended in line with your decisions, will be delivered to the community through the Elrond Network. In the distribution of the income from the comics, a share will be taken at the rate of NFT you hold.</p>
